Sierpinski Carpet -- Sierpinski pattern (or Wallis sieve) is a fractal pattern often seen in Triangles or Carpet form. "SierpinskiCarpet.java" utilizes the recursion of a single quadrilateral,
                     and the "drawingPanel.java" class to draw the Sierpinski pattern. The pattern is intialized by first drawing a single quadrilateral, disecting it into
                     a 9 x 9 grid, and then removing the center quadrilateral.
