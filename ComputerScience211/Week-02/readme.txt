Article Reverser -- Utilizes an arraylist to intake the text file I chose of one of my favorite poems, "Go All The Way" - Charles Bukowski" (which seems relevant during
the era of Covid-19), and inserts the words into the array -- which is then reversed using the Collectionse.reverse (java.util) to reverse the order, and finally calling
to print the then reversed article by it's storage variable (poem2).
