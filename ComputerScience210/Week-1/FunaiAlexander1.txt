1. Computers use binary numbers, because it was more convenient to engineer mechanical devices (computers) responding to an open circuit (zeros and ones), in comparison to a more complicated system using a base-10 system. Using a binary system rather than a base-10 system results in device to being produced easier and more reliably. 
2. A) 6 = 110
B) 44 = 10100
C) 72 = 1001000
D) 131 = 10000011
3. A) 100 = 4
B) 1011 = 11
C) 101010 = 42
D) 1001110 = 78
4. An algorithm for baking cookies would consist of preparing the batch, and then baking the batch. I would create unique methods for baking and mixing, so they could be re-used for doubling the output (“batches produced”).
5. There are differences between a .java file and a .class file. A .java file holds the source code for a file/project, and the .class file is the converted .java file in bytecode.
6. ABC / AnnualSalary / sum_of_data / 42isTheAnswer / B4.
7. System.out.println(“Hello, world!”);
