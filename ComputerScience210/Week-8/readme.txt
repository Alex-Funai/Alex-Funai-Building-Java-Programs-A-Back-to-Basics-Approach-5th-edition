---> Assignment 8 <---

Rational Numbers -- Utilizes constructors, private variables, and .this reference variable to compute basic mathematical arithmetic operations for a rational number.
                    Use of .this reference variable to not override variable's value, as the program concludes by printing out various operations which entail different
                    numbers; and this minimizes redundancy in variable storage/initialization.
