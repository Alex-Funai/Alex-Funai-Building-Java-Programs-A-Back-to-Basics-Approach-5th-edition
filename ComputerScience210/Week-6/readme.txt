BabyNames -- This program asks the user for a name (must be on the list of names.txt), and will return the name's popularity rank out of #1000
             for a series of decades between 1920-2000. Utilizes scanner to read through the names.txt with a while.hasnextline loop, and differentiates
             the postluding integers as decades by increments of 10 years. Finally -- incoorporates PrintWriter w/ (throws FileNotFoundException) to print
             and store the results as new file named ada.txt, and then print the results to the user.
