Building Java Programs: Chapter 9 -- Inheritance and Interfaces

1.	Code reuse is the practice of reusing code again throughout a program.
2.	There are differences between overloading and overriding a method.  The main differences are that overloading a method reuses a method w/ different variables so it doesn’t disregard the original. Overriding methods occurs when a method is recalled with the same exact parameters and there for it overwrites the original method values.
3.	Syntax to indicate that class A is a subclass of B:
public class A extends B {
4.	This keyword refers to values within a method, and super regards to the superclass’s values.
5.	//
6.	public UnderGraduateStudent (String name) {
super (name, 18);
year = 0; }
7.	public void setAge (int age) {
super.setAge (age);
year++; }

20.	52 subclasses would cause unnecessary clutter in design. One class with two type fields for rank and suit would be more ideal.
